          Hi again 👋🏼, I'm Shay..
          <br />
          I've always been drawn to the magic that happens when technology and
          design come together. That's what led me to become a frontend
          developer.
          <br />
          With a strong handle on frontend technologies, I'm here to bring your
          vision to life, blending beautiful design with seamless functionality,
          speed, compatibility, and accessibility.
          <br />I love keeping up with the latest trends in development and
          design so I can always deliver the best for your company and personal
          projects.
          <br /> Let's create something amazing together!
